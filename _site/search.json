    "text": "Project 2\nThis project investigates the combined effects of alcohol, exercise, and music type on reaction times within a controlled virtual human population. By examining these three factors and their interactions, the study aims to understand how each influences cognitive function, particularly in social and high-stakes scenarios where reaction time is critical. Using a factorial design, the research explores how alcohol consumption, moderate exercise, and the choice between heavy metal and classical music affect reaction times, aiming to identify strategies for improving cognitive responsiveness. The findings have practical applications in fields like athletics, workplace productivity, and everyday decision-making."
