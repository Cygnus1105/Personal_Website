## Project 1

The project investigates the factors that influence the commercial success of popular music in the digital era, focusing on how variables like streams, downloads, radio plays, and ratings affect song sales. Using the "Top Songs of the World" dataset from Kaggle, the study employs multiple regression analysis to uncover the dynamics driving music popularity and sales. The research aims to provide insights into the evolving digital music landscape, emphasizing the growing importance of streaming and other digital metrics for stakeholders in the music industry.

## Project 2

This project investigates the combined effects of alcohol, exercise, and music type on reaction times within a controlled virtual human population. By examining these three factors and their interactions, the study aims to understand how each influences cognitive function, particularly in social and high-stakes scenarios where reaction time is critical. Using a factorial design, the research explores how alcohol consumption, moderate exercise, and the choice between heavy metal and classical music affect reaction times, aiming to identify strategies for improving cognitive responsiveness. The findings have practical applications in fields like athletics, workplace productivity, and everyday decision-making.

## Project 3

This project focuses on predicting the outcomes of NBA games using statistical models based on data from the 2023 NBA regular season. It explores various features such as average score differences, historical performance trends, home advantage, and offensive/defensive efficiency. By leveraging data-driven insights, the study aims to understand the factors influencing game outcomes and improve prediction accuracy. The research employs machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, to analyze patterns and trends in team performance, offering valuable tools for strategic decision-making in sports analytics.
